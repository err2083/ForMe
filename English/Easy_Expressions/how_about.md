## 스크립트

I want to tell you about how my husband proposed to me when we were in college.

I was studying in the libray and he just came to me and asked, "How about having a cup of tea with me?"

So, that's how our first date was, at a cafe.

And he asked me for a second date a few days later.

"How about watching a movie together"

I loved the movie and we started dating after that.

I loved his sense of humor.

But i never thought about marrying him.

But one day, I realized that he wanted to marry me.

He said, "How about having dinner with our family?"

And we are now a happy married couple of 15 years!
