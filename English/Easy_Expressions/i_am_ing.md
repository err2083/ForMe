## 스크립트

I am overweight.

So I decided to go on a diet.

Tonight, I am going out to the park, I am walking now.

After a while, I am ready to exercise.

So I think, "Hmm, why don't I run faster? That way, I will use up more energy." So, I am running now.

Now I'm really tired and sweaty.

So I return home to take a shower.

Now I'm really hungry!

No, no. Eating late at night is bad for my diet!

But I think I can start my diet tomorrow.

I am eating potato chips.
