## 스크립트

I'll read you a page from my diary. Okay?

So, I am lost in the jungle.

I don't have any food with me.

I am hungry.

Plus, it is raining.

Of course, I don't have an umbrella, so

I am wet now.

So, it's very cold at night.

Luckily, I see an airplane in the sky.

I wave my hands!

They see me.

I am happy.

I think I will go home now!
