## 스크립트

My brother and I went to an amusement park.

It was our first time going there.

We were all very excited.

"There are lots of of rides here!"

But we were really hungry.

We needed to eat something first.

"There are lots of food stands here!"

We bought many kind of snacks and ate for hours.

"Now I'm ready for rides. Let's go!"

But it was too crowded to walk walk around.

"Oh, my goodness! There are lots of people in line now! We should have gone on the rides first..."
