## 스크립트

One of my best friends works out really hard.

He started working out for his diet, but soon he started really liking sports.

"I love playing sports!"

I think he is now addicted to it.

He tried cycliing, marathon, swimming, etc.

These days, he is very into boxing.

"I love boxing!"

But what happened to his diet?

It was weird that he was getting bigger and bigger.

"Did you lose some weight?" I asked.

And he said, "You know that I love eating too. Right? I love eating!"
